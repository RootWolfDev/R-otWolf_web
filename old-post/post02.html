         <em>1-what is markdown language?</em>
         <p>> Markdown is a lightweight markup language used for creating formatted text using a <br>
            plain-text editor. It was created by John Gruber in 2004 with the goal of making a markup <br>
             language that is easy to read and write. 
              </p>
         <em>2-haw you can use it?</em>
         <p>> you can use markdown language to creating formatted text,you can use it in github to write  <br>
             post or to building a website, it a very easy language.
           i learned this language in 30min , but for website i always use HTML to improve it , <br>
           so markdown it's for simply text not like HTML it builded for website
         </p>    
         <em>3-markdown for beginner:</em>
         <p>> first you have to use a studio code app for example <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">visual studio code </a><br>
           - create a file with .md in the end like file.md <br>
           - if you use visual studio code you can install <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one">Markdown All in One</a> to help you <br>
           <hr>

          <img src="../image/markdown.png" alt=""><br>
          >to write an italic word you have to use _ or *  <br>
          for exemple: <br>
          <img src="../image/image1.png" alt=""><br>
          also for a strong word you use __ or ** 
          <img src="../image/image2.png" alt=""><br>
          >now haw to create a link it's easy [name](url) <br>
          <img src="../image/image3.png" alt=""><br>
          >order list:
          1. <br>
          2. <br>
          ... <br>
          >to write a code do this <br>
          ```python <br>
          print("hello") <br>
          ``` <br>
          >this for image <br>
          <code>![image](url)</code> <br>
          >and finaly this for table:
          <pre>
            <code>
                  |name|age|
                  |----|----|
                  |wolf|16|</code>
